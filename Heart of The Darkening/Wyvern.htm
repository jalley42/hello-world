</table>

<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 60 ft.; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Grab
 (Ex)
</b> If you hit with the indicated attack (usually a claw or bite attack), you deal normal damage and can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. You have the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of your body you used in the grab to hold the opponent. If you choose to do the latter, you takes a -20 penalty on your CMB check to make and maintain the grapple, but do not gain the grappled condition itself. A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless you also have the constrict special attack. If you do not constrict, each successful grapple check you make during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, you deal constriction damage as well. You receive a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to start and maintain a grapple. Unless otherwise noted, grab can only be used on creatures of a size equal to or smaller than you.</p>
<p><b>Immunity to Magical Sleep
 (Ex)
</b> You are never subject to magic sleep effects.</p>
<p><b>Immunity to Paralysis
 (Ex)
</b> You can never be paralyzed.</p>
<p><b>Low-Light Vision
 (Ex)
</b> You can see x2 as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-Light Vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.</p>
<p><b>Poison
 (Ex)
</b> Sting--injury; save DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.</p>
<p><b>Rake
 (Ex)
</b> You gain extra natural attacks under certain conditions, typically when you grapple foes. In addition to the options available to all grapplers, a monster with the rake ability gains two additional claw attacks that it can use only against a grappled foe. A monster with the rake ability must begin its turn already grappling to use its rake--it can&#39;t begin a grapple and rake in the same turn.</p>
<p><b>Scent
 (Ex)
</b> You can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. You can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights. You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed--only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When you are within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source&#39;s location. You can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry&#39;s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival skill. When tracking by scent you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.</p>
